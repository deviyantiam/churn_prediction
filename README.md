# Project Overview

This repository contains the code for a churn prediction project. The project is organized into two main folders:

## 1. Training

The `training` folder contains Jupyter notebooks (`*.ipynb`) for initial data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. These notebooks provide a overview of the data exploration process and the development of models for churn prediction.

## 2. App

The `app` folder contains the code for a churn prediction application. This application facilitates batching predictions based on historical data and allows users to fetch churn scores by specific customer_id using an API.

## Usage

To utilize the churn prediction application, follow the instructions provided in the `app` folder. Detailed documentation on how to use the API is included within the app's collection file.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your specific needs. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. [my linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deviyanti-am/).
